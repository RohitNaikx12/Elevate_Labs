## 1. What is phishing?
Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other confidential data. It is often carried out through emails, fake websites, or messages.

## 2. How to identify a phishing email?
- Unexpected or unsolicited email from an unknown sender.
- Poor grammar, spelling mistakes, or unusual language.
- Urgent or threatening language encouraging immediate action.
- Suspicious links or attachments.
- Email addresses or URLs that mimic legitimate organizations (e.g., amaz0n.com).

## 3. What is email spoofing?
Email spoofing is a technique used by attackers to forge the sender address in an email header to make it appear as though the message came from a trusted source. It is commonly used in phishing attacks to trick recipients.

## 4. Why are phishing emails dangerous?
- They can lead to identity theft or financial loss.
- They may install malware or ransomware on the victim’s system.
- They exploit human trust and psychological manipulation.
- They can compromise personal, corporate, or government data.

## 5. How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?
- Check the sender’s full email address carefully.
- Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking.
- Verify with the sender through another communication channel.
- Look for digital signatures or SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication headers.

## 6. What tools can analyze email headers?
- MXToolbox (https://mxtoolbox.com)
- Google Admin Toolbox Messageheader tool
- Microsoft Message Header Analyzer
- Mailheader.org

## 7. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?
- Do not click on any links or download attachments.
- Report the email to your IT or security team.
- Mark the email as spam or phishing in your email client.
- Delete the email from your inbox and trash folder.
- Educate others about the phishing attempt.

## 8. How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?
Attackers manipulate human emotions like fear, curiosity, or urgency to trick victims. Common tactics include pretending to be a boss requesting sensitive data, a bank alerting about a suspicious transaction, or a friend in need. These messages are crafted to lower the victim’s guard and prompt hasty actions.
