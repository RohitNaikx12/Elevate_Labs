# Task 6 – Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong, test it using password strength tools, and document best practices.

---

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Create Multiple Passwords**
   - Example set:
     - Weak: `password123`
     - Medium: `P@ssword2024`
     - Strong: `K!8gTz#9Qw*1`

2. **Use Complexity Rules**
   - Mix **uppercase + lowercase**
   - Include **numbers**
   - Add **special characters**
   - Minimum length **12+ characters**

3. **Test on Password Strength Checkers**
   - Websites:  
     - [https://passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)  
     - [https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)

4. **Record Results**
   - Weak password → Low score, vulnerable to brute force/dictionary attacks.
   - Strong password → High score, estimated crack time in centuries.

5. **Evaluate Best Practices**
   - Avoid dictionary words.
   - Use random combinations.
   - Consider passphrases like `"BlueTiger!Runs$Fast1987"`.

## Findings (Example Password Strength Test)

| Password            | Length | Complexity Level | Estimated Crack Time |
|---------------------|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| `password123`       | 11     | Weak             | Less than a second   |
| `P@ssword2024`      | 12     | Medium           | Hours to days        |
| `K!8gTz#9Qw*1`      | 12     | Strong           | Centuries            |
| `BlueTiger!Runs$Fast1987` | 22 | Very Strong     | Billions of years    |

## Interview Questions & Answers

1. **What makes a password strong?**  
   Length (12+ chars), randomness, mixed character types, no dictionary words.

2. **What are common password attacks?**  
   Brute force, dictionary attacks, phishing, credential stuffing.

3. **Why is password length important?**  
   Longer passwords exponentially increase cracking difficulty.

4. **What is a dictionary attack?**  
   An attack where an attacker tries words from a predefined list.

5. **What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?**  
   A security method requiring two or more verification steps.

6. **How do password managers help?**  
   They store and generate strong unique passwords securely.

7. **What are passphrases?**  
   Long, memorable sequences of random words with added complexity.

8. **What are common mistakes in password creation?**  
   Using names, birthdates, repeated patterns, or simple sequences.
