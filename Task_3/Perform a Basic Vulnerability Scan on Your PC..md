## Basic Vulnerability Scan on Your PC
---
## Objective

Perform a vulnerability scan using OpenVAS Community Edition or Nessus Essentials to identify common security issues on your computer.

---

## Tools Used

- **[OpenVAS Community Edition](https://www.greenbone.net/en/community-edition/)** *(or Nessus Essentials)*

---

## Steps Performed

1. **Installation:**  
   Installed and set up OpenVAS (or Nessus Essentials) as per official documentation.
2. **Scan Target:**  
   Targeted my local machine IP (localhost/127.0.0.1).
3. **Full Scan:**  
   Executed a full vulnerability scan.
4. **Review:**  
   Reviewed the scan report for detected vulnerabilities and noted severity.
5. **Remediation:**  
   Researched solutions for the most critical/high-severity findings.

---

## Key Vulnerabilities Discovered

*Replace these with your genuine findings! Possible examples:*
- **Outdated OpenSSH version** – High severity
- **Unpatched operating system updates** – High severity
- **SMBv1 protocol enabled** – Medium severity
- **Default/weak passwords detected** – High severity

---

## Remediation Steps

- Updated system software and installed security patches.
- Disabled insecure protocols/features (e.g., SMBv1).
- Changed weak/default passwords.
- Disabled unnecessary services.

## Interview Questions

### 1. **What is vulnerability scanning?**
Vulnerability scanning is an automated process that examines computers/networks to discover known security weaknesses and exposures.

### 2. **Difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?**
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated; detects and lists weaknesses without exploiting them.
- **Penetration Testing:** Manual and automated; actively attempts to exploit vulnerabilities to assess impact.

### 3. **Common vulnerabilities in personal computers:**
- Outdated software/OS
- Weak passwords
- Misconfigured firewalls or networking
- Unnecessary or open services/ports

### 4. **How do scanners detect vulnerabilities?**
Scanners check your systems against a database of known vulnerabilities, using version numbers, banners, and configuration checks.

### 5. **What is CVSS?**
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) rates the severity of vulnerabilities from 0 (none) to 10 (critical).

### 6. **How often should vulnerability scans be performed?**
Ideally monthly, or after major system changes. Critical/production systems may need weekly scans.

### 7. **What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?**
A report of a vulnerability that is not actually present on the target system.

### 8. **How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?**
By severity (CVSS score), exploitability, potential impact, exposure, and whether the system is internet-facing.
